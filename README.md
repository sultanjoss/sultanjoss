- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @sultanjoss

</a>
I'm a Quality Engineer with a Bachelor's degree in Sharia Economics, and I've recently completed the Quality Engineering Training Program at Alterra Academy. Throughout my training, I acquired in-depth expertise in both manual and automation testing. I've successfully executed projects involving automated tests using Java and have achieved a success rate of over 90% in manual API and web testing. I possess strong leadership abilities, excel in teamwork, and am an effective public speaker. I am now actively seeking opportunities to enhance my professional competence while making contributions as quality engineer.

- I am interested in analysis and creating manual and automated tests
- I am looking forward to collaborating on open-source projects.
- Feel free to ask me anything, and I'll be happy to help, as long as it's within my knowledge
- Outside of tech, I love watching movies, editing photos videos, and exploring nature outdoors.
